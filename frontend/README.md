# Tripleten web_project_around_auth

This project is a share photos app created for one of the Sprints of the Web Developer course offered by Practicum.

This website lets people add and delete a picture card to/from their database. The user can also change their profile info and avatar, by fetching from the server.

Only people logged in can see the cards. They can signup for the service in the signup page, then log in.

## Tools Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js

## Avaliable Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

## Next Steps

- Currently the project is running off of 2 different servers, so the next step is to have it run from only one.
- Add more security features
